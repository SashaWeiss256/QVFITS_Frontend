/* Shop Seed (from Quivogue js/data.js) */

/* ==========================================================================
   The catalogue and shop content carried over from the Quivogue static site.
   Only services in src/store/tanstackStore/services import this file; the
   admin edits it through the collection store while mocks are on, and the
   API replaces it at launch (docs/03-data-layer.md).

   WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT

   REAL, and sourced — marked // REAL below:
     · Brand name "QV fits", handle @quivogue, TikTok @quivoguefits
     · Showroom: THE CUBE, G17, Kisementi, Kampala
     · WhatsApp / orders: +256 758 981 959
     · What they make: premium seamless & seam-fit activewear, swim and
       lounge wear
     · Golf & tennis skort wear: sizes XS–XL, with an inbuilt pant,
       described by the brand as multifunctional sportswear

   NOT REAL — placeholders you must replace before launch:
     · Every PRICE (marked // PRICE TBC). No prices are published anywhere
       public, so all of them are invented.
     · Size runs and stock counts, except the XS–XL noted above.
     · Delivery fees and the returns window.
     · Most product names and descriptions. The four pieces marked
       // REAL PIECE are ones actually seen in the brand's own posts.

   REVIEWS is deliberately EMPTY. QV fits has no public review listing that
   could be verified, and the review blocks stay hidden until you paste real
   ones in. Nothing here is carried over from the previous brand.

   PHOTOS
   brand/logo.png is the shop's real logo (the QV FITS wave mark, EST. 2023),
   taken from their Instagram profile picture with the white background
   knocked out. The site's magenta-to-purple accent is sampled from it.

   photos/ mixes two sources:
     · REAL QV photography — their own Instagram posts at full resolution
       plus the QVFIT studio product shots Jay supplied. These cover the hero,
       about, the campaign banner, every category tile, all four kit cards and
       most of the catalogue.
     · NO VIDEO STILLS. Earlier versions used frames lifted from their TikTok
       clips; all of those have been removed at Jay's request.
     · A shrinking remainder is free-licence stock filler, lightly graded to
       match. Replace it as real product photography arrives.
   Filenames map to product ids: <id>.jpg, plus -2 / -3 for the gallery.

    q: 'What is the difference between seamless and seam-fit?',
    a: 'Seamless is knitted as one tube, so there are no side seams to rub — it hugs and moves with you. Seam-fit is cut and stitched from panels, which lets us build in structure, support and mesh exactly where they are needed. Seamless for comfort and shape, seam-fit for support.'

    q: 'How should activewear fit?',

  },

    q: 'How do I care for it?',
